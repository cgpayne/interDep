For core packages, in your virtual environment run:
  pip3 install req-core.txt

For the full monty, in your virtual environment run:
  pip3 install req-full.txt

I made the latter via 'pip3 freeze > req-full.txt',
and the former by cp/editting out random dependencies
of which I didn't recognize.

Why am I deviating from the status quo, you ask?
In one's search for Heaven on Earth,
we do not deserve to be stuck in Dependency Hell.
